0.14	Removed inconsistent spelling of "suite".

0.13	Now the cursor is moved out of the way during gameplay (some terminal
	emulators don't support making the cursor invisible).

	In the help menu, if "any key" was a cursor key, the text viewer would
	skip ahead more than one page. Fixed.

	Added some runtime options, enabling the user to change the suite
	symbols.

0.12	Internal beta release.
