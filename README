This is freecell, a console (ncurses) version of the popular solitaire
game.

Please refer to the file 'INSTALL' for installation instructions. Once the game
has been installed, simply run it and type '?' for gameplay instructions (or
read the man page).

Modern freecell was invented by Paul Alfille in 1978.

This implementation of freecell was written from scratch by Linus Akesson
<linus@linusakesson.net> in 2007.
